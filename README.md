Post-processing algorithm for binary classification with abstention and DP constraints


This code requires the latest version of scipy.
Due to this fact, sometimes we run into the this bug: https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/issues/981

So far we simply run the code again, as it is not clear why this bug pop-up at all..
